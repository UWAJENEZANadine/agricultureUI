                 Agri e-commerce also increases farmers' access to new markets and 
                 adds transparency to the value chain. It enables
                  farmers to bypass several intermediaries, 
                  resulting in higher income for the farmers,
                  reduced wastage, and the potential to deliver
                   fresher produce to customers.<br/>
